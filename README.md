# Tourism-Guide
A tropical state of mind awaits you in Bali. With its breezy beaches, swaying palm trees and quirky beach shacks, the agenda of Bali tourism is to simply do
nothing but chill out. Of course, its volcanic mountains, seashores dotted with coral reefs and iconic rice paddies will surely tempt you to feel active. 
And as for the vibrant nightlife, suffice to know that sleep will be the farthest thing on your mind. The Balinese population will surely win you over with their 
broad smiles and their ready warmth, so you never feel out of place. Fact is, Bali tourism is a vacation that you want to keep going back to, 
even when copious amounts of work stare you in the face. This is an island like no other. 

This project gives you complete tour of Bali and its culture.
