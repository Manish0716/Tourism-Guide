       <h1>Barong Temple</h1>
       <p> Kupu Kupu Barong Villas & Tree Spa was named after groups of giant butterflies that beautifully fly around the resort. In Balinese language, Barong is also means Giant and Kupu Kupu is Indonesian language meaning Butterfly. Hence, the resort, Kupu Kupu Barong means Giant Butterfly.
        While visiting a temple in Bali, you will notice that everybody wears a colourful scarf tied at the waist with a piece of fabric. This is called a “sarong”. A sarong is a rectangular piece of fabric, often printed with various patterns and colours. Some common designs are flowers, animals or graphic designs. A very traditional dyeing technique is called “Batik”. Batik could mean “writing dots” as this technique uses wax to make drawings on the fabric that will be dyed. But don’t worry in you don’t have your own sarong when visiting a temple in Bali. You can usually buy or rent one at the entrance of any temple in Bali.

        <h1>Tegalalang Rice Terrace</h1>
        <p>The Tegalalang Rice Terrace is another fabulous tourism spot in Bali. The scenic views of the terraced layout of the rice paddies across a lush valley make it a favorite Instagrammable spot. Chat with the local farmers to get an insight into the traditional irrigation system of these terraces.</p>

        <h1>Mount Batur</h1>
        <p>Mount Batur (Gunung Batur) is an active volcano located at the center of two concentric calderas north west of Mount Agung on the island of Bali, Indonesia. The south east side of the larger 10×13 km caldera contains a caldera lake. The inner 7.5-kilometer-wide caldera, which was formed during emplacement of the Bali (or Ubud) ignimbrite, has been dated at about 23,670 and 28,500 years ago</p>

        <h1>Crystal Bay</h1>
        <p> This sheltered cove is almost perfect: with blue-green waters, sloping palm trees, rocky islets just offshore and a hilly backdrop, it is also astoundingly undeveloped. With more cattle grazing than tourists lazing, it is so idyllic because it’s so isolated: on Nusa Penida island, an hour by speedboat from Bali, and only accessible by chartered vehicle or rented motorbike. With only a few laidback bungalows nearby and a handful of thatched-roof cafés on the sand, the reefs are popular among scuba-divers and snorkelers who mostly arrive by boat from more developed regions.</p>
